The Simo API is an HTTP/REST-based API for various services, typically used on the front end with some wrapper library.

## Authentication

Authentication can be done in two ways:

1. Using Json Web Token (less common method, usually used on the front end).
2. Using an api-key generated on the [Simo botlist](https://bombadeagua.life) website.

All authentications must be placed in the `Authorization` header in an HTTP request.

### Example

- Using api-key

```json
{
    "Authorization": "0jija6272bfda-e4jb2bj6bje5c-2icdeg51ee0jb"
}
```

- Using Json Web Token

```json
{
    "Authorization": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.UG9yIHF1ZSB2b2PDqiB0ZW50b3UgZGVjb2RpZmljYXIgaXNzbz8.cXaza7vgMrvJR0MXihfaSh7eJUXzsFdmK-b4c_8dEZg"
}
```

## Types

How are the types documented? The types follow the TypeScript standard. Some fields may contain the value `null`, and some fields may be optional.

### Examples of Nullable and Optional Fields

| NAME          | TYPE     |
| ------------- | -------- |
| nullable      | ?string  |
| optional?     | string   |
| normal_field  | string   |

## Dates

Whenever it is necessary to save the creation/update date of something, ISO8601 dates are used.

## Errors

Errors may or may not have the `errors` property. Errors are designed to be human-readable. With almost every new update, a new error is added (you can view them in [errors](/api/utils/errors.json)). Examples of errors:

Normal error:

```json
{
    "message": "Unknown user",
    "code": 5001
}
```

Errors with `errors`:

```json
{
    "errors": [
        "vote_message must be a `string` type, but the final value was: `2`."
    ]
}
```
