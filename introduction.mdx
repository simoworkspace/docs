## Libraries

You can interact with the API in different ways instead of using the raw API. Using API wrappers makes it easier to interact with the actual API.

### `@simo.js/rest`

With `@simo.js/rest`, you can create and interact with the Simo API in a better way.

Getting the current user:

```js
const { REST, Routes } = require("@simo.js/rest");

const rest = new REST({ auth: "API-AUTH" });

const userData = await rest.get(Routes.getUser("@me"));

console.log("Username:", userData.username);
```

### `@simo.js/simo.js`

A powerful library that allows you to interact with any route and method of the Simo API.

Creating a bot:

```js
const { API } = require("@simo.js/simo.js");

const client = new API({
    auth: "API-AUTH",
});

await client.bots.create({
    invite_url: "bot-invite",
    short_description: "Some short description goes here",
    long_description: "Some looooong description goes here...",
    prefixes: ["s!", "s?"],
    tags: ["economy"],
});
```
